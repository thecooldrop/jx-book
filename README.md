# Welcome to the world of GitOps with Jenkins X

Hello dear readers, and welcome the repository. 

As per title the goal of this repository is to provide a book  for learning about managing and using Jenkins X. As the
tooling provided by Jenkins is covers a large number of functionalities and integrations I have felt that a thorough
introduction to the principles and structure behind Jenkins-X workfolows is necessary.

Hopefully you will enjoy reading this book, and will be able to learn Jenkins-X and it's internals togehter with the
repository contributors.
